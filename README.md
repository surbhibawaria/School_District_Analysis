# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria the chief data scientist for a city school district is responsible for analyzing information from a variety of sources, and in a variety of formats. In this role she is tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic descisions at the school and district level.

Later, Maria and her supervisor got notified about the evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. So, this analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.

### Purpose
The pupose of this analysis is to help Maria analyze data on student funding and student's standardized test scores, and to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. Also, to repeat the school district analysis to see how does replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact affected the overall analysis.

## Results

After all the ninth-grade student data for Thomas High School was replaced with NaN, below are the affected results summmarized:

### The District Summary

As we can see below, for the district summary, there are nominal changes in some of the values from the original analysis to the repeated analysis. Athough the average math score, average reading score, passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, and overall passing percentage show minute changes, the changes are less than 1% and can be round off easily. While rest of the data, total schools, total students, and total budget remains the same.

### The School Summary

For the school summary we can see below, there's a significant drop of percentages from the original analysis to repeated analysis. The passing math percentage dropped from 93% to 67%, passing reading percentage dropped from 97% to 69%, and the overall passing percentage dropped from 91% to 65%. So, replacing the 9th grade students from the data set and recalculating with 10th - 12th grade has a huge impact on the data set.
